## Project

GROUNDWORK is a cozy ecological voxel garden builder game. The player composes ecosystems by shaping soil, water, light, and plant relationships above and below ground. Core fantasy: build a living miniature world that becomes self-sustaining, surprising, and teeming with life over time.

**What makes it sticky:** The garden is not just plants and physics — it's an interconnected web of life. Fauna (insects, birds, worms, pollinators) create visible relationships between plants. Ecological discovery unfolds in layers: first you learn mechanics, then competition, then synergy, then you design self-sustaining loops. The game rewards observation with surprise — consequences you didn't plan but can trace backward.

**What makes it replayable:** Two pillars drive "one more garden" across hundreds of hours. First, *knowledge transfer* — each garden teaches something that changes how you start the next one. Your tenth garden looks different from your first not because of unlocks, but because you *understand ecology now*. Second, *biome variety* — each biome is a complete ecosystem with its own species, interactions, fauna, and visual identity. Mastering temperate doesn't prepare you for desert. Systemic intuition transfers; specific recipes don't. And each biome's art, lighting, and atmosphere is a pull motivator on its own — you want to see what that world *looks and feels like*. See `decisions/2026-03-15T18:00:00_replayability_model.md`.

**The gardener gnome:** The player doesn't directly manipulate voxels. Instead, you **zone areas** (drag-to-paint) and a charming **garden gnome** character waddles over and does the work — planting seeds, digging trenches, shaping irrigation channels. The gnome is a **sim-side entity** (following the fauna pattern): it has hunger, energy, and builds trust with fauna like squirrels and birds. Ghost overlays show planned-but-not-yet-executed work. The garden sustains the gnome; the gnome tends the garden. See `decisions/2026-03-16T12:00:00_gardener_gnome_zone_planning.md`. **Executive mandate.**

**Irrigation, not watering can:** There is no water placement tool. Water comes from natural sources (springs, rain, ponds). Players dig channels with the shovel to guide water flow toward their plants — **Timberborn-style terrain shaping**. Irrigation is the "road" mechanic: you optimize hydration by sculpting the terrain. The `water_flow` sim system handles gravity-driven flow and lateral spread automatically. See `decisions/2026-03-17T12:00:00_irrigation_replaces_watering_can.md`. **Executive mandate.**

**Current phase:** Core game development. The simulation foundation is complete (12 species, water/light/soil/root systems, procedural trees). The primary workstream is now the **Three.js web renderer** — making the game beautiful and playable in the browser.

## Sprint Session (one-liner)

For a full development cycle — sync, prioritize, build, ship, playtest, repeat:

```bash
claude "$(cat prompts/sprint.md)"
```

This runs the SYNC → MANAGE → DEV → SHIP → PLAYTEST loop. SYNC pulls in feedback from previous sessions and async contributors. PLAYTEST evaluates what just shipped and feeds the next cycle. See `prompts/sprint.md` for details.

## Session Quick Start

Every session, you operate as one of three roles. Pick yours and follow the checklist.

**First-time setup (run once per clone):**
```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
This activates pre-commit (`cargo fmt --check` + `tsc`) and pre-push (`cargo clippy`) hooks.

**Role assignment:**
1. If a role is specified in the prompt, use it.
2. Default to **dev** if dev work is available (check `handoffs/manager_to_dev/` and `backlog/current.md`).
3. Fall back to **manager** if no dev work but feedback exists to review (check `feedback/` and `handoffs/player_to_manager/`).
4. Fall back to **player** if nothing else applies.

### Dev — start here
1. Read `agents/dev.md` (your role definition)
2. Read `backlog/current.md` (what's prioritized)
3. Read latest file in `handoffs/manager_to_dev/` (your current assignment)
4. Read latest file in `build_notes/` (where the last dev left off)
5. Build and test: `cargo test -p groundwork-sim && cargo check --workspace`
6. For web work: `cd crates/groundwork-web && npm install && npm run dev`
7. Do the work. Write build notes and dev→manager handoff when done.

### Manager — start here
1. Read `agents/manager.md` (your role definition)
2. Read `backlog/current.md` (current priorities)
3. Read latest files in `feedback/` and `handoffs/player_to_manager/` (new player input)
4. Read latest files in `handoffs/dev_to_manager/` (dev results)
5. Update backlog, write decisions, write handoffs to dev and/or player.

### Player — start here
1. Read `agents/player.md` (your role definition)
2. Read latest file in `handoffs/manager_to_player/` (what to test and specific questions)
3. **Capture actual rendered frames** — you MUST see the game visually:
   - Browser: `cd crates/groundwork-web && npm run dev` then open http://localhost:5173
   - LLM agent: run `npm run playtest` (Playwright harness captures PNGs to `artifacts/screenshots/`)
4. Play a session with visual evidence and write feedback + player→manager handoff.

All roles: read `AGENTS.md` for the full operating framework (vision, handoff formats, priority definitions, workspace rules).

### Key Design Decisions

- **bevy_ecs standalone**: fast compile (~60s cold, <1s incremental), simulation-only
- **Renderer-agnostic sim**: `groundwork-sim` has zero rendering deps. Web and TUI are thin shells that read sim state.
- **Three.js + WASM hybrid**: Sim compiles to WASM via wasm-bindgen. Three.js reads the voxel grid via zero-copy typed array views into WASM memory. JS hot-reloads for visual iteration. See `decisions/2026-03-13T18:00:00_3d_web_renderer_plan.md`.
- **Zero-copy data path**: VoxelGrid is a flat array (640K × 4 bytes = 2.56MB). JS reads it directly from WASM linear memory as a `Uint8Array`.
- **Greedy meshing with chunking**: 80×80×100 grid divides into 16×16×16 chunks. Per-vertex AO. Only dirty chunks re-mesh after tick.
- **Scale normalization**: All dimensions in meters, converted via `scale.rs`. `VOXEL_SIZE_M = 0.5`.
- **Flat voxel array**: 640K voxels in contiguous Vec. Z=0 is deepest, Z=GROUND_LEVEL (~50) is surface, Z=99 is sky.
- **12 species, 4 plant types**: Tree/Shrub/Groundcover/Flower. Trees use space colonization branching, others use templates.
- **System execution order**: water_spring → water_flow → soil_absorption → root_water_absorption → soil_evolution → light_propagation → seed_growth → tree_growth → branch_growth → tree_rasterize → self_pruning → seed_dispersal → tick_counter
- **Garden gnome mediated actions**: Player zones are queued via `queue_gnome_task()` WASM export. The gnome is a sim-side entity (like fauna) with position, task queue, hunger, energy, and fauna trust. Gnome walks to tasks and applies tools on arrival. Renderer reads gnome state via zero-copy export buffer. See `decisions/2026-03-16T12:00:00_gardener_gnome_zone_planning.md`.
- **Irrigation, not watering can**: No water placement tool. Water flows from natural sources (springs, rain) through player-dug channels. Terrain shaping IS water management — Timberborn-style. See `decisions/2026-03-17T12:00:00_irrigation_replaces_watering_can.md`.

### Sim API

```rust
let mut world = groundwork_sim::create_world();
let mut schedule = groundwork_sim::create_schedule();
groundwork_sim::tick(&mut world, &mut schedule);
let grid = world.resource::<VoxelGrid>();
```

### WASM Bridge API

```
Rust exports (via wasm-bindgen, in wasm_bridge.rs):
  init()                    → Create world + schedule
  tick(n)                   → Advance n ticks
  grid_ptr() → *const u8   → Pointer to VoxelGrid flat array
  grid_len() → usize       → Length in bytes (640K × 4)
  soil_ptr() → *const u8   → Pointer to SoilGrid flat array
  soil_len() → usize       → Length in bytes
  grid_width/height/depth() → Grid dimensions
  get_tick() → u64          → Current tick count
  place_tool(tool, x, y, z) → Apply gardening tool
  fill_tool(tool, x1..z2)  → Fill region
  get_focus_x/y/z()        → Camera focus point
  set_focus(x, y, z)       → Set camera focus

JS reads:
  new Uint8Array(wasm.memory.buffer, grid_ptr(), grid_len())
  // Each voxel: [material: u8, water_level: u8, light_level: u8, nutrient_level: u8]
```

## Gardening Tools

All tools are used by **painting zones** (drag-to-select area). The garden gnome then walks to each zoned voxel and executes the action. Ghost overlays show planned work before execution.

- `air`/`dig` = **shovel** — removes anything (seeds, roots, soil, stone). Also the primary **irrigation tool**: dig channels from water sources to gardens. Ghost: red-brown wireframe.
- `seed` = **seed bag** — plants a seed; falls through air; dies on stone. Ghost: soft green pulse.
- `soil` = **soil** — places soil; falls through air. Use for berms, dams, and raised beds to direct water flow. Ghost: translucent warm brown.
- `stone` = **stone** — places stone directly (no gravity). Use for permanent water barriers and aqueducts. Ghost: translucent gray.

**No watering can.** Water comes from natural sources (springs, rain). Players shape terrain to create irrigation channels. See `decisions/2026-03-17T12:00:00_irrigation_replaces_watering_can.md`.

## Species
- **Trees:** `oak`, `birch`, `willow`, `pine` — tall, space colonization branching
- **Shrubs:** `fern`, `berry-bush`, `holly` — bushy, 1-2m, template-only
- **Flowers:** `wildflower`, `daisy` — thin stem + bloom, fast growing
- **Groundcover:** `moss`, `grass`, `clover` — flat disc, spreads quickly

## Fauna
- **Pollinators:** `bee`, `butterfly` — spawn near flower clusters, boost seed nutrients
- **Dispersers:** `bird` — spawn near mature trees, carry seeds 10-50 voxels
- **Decomposers:** `worm`, `beetle` — enrich soil, break down dead wood
- **Companions:** `squirrel` — spawn near oak/berry, domesticable by the gnome, cache acorns that sprout

## Onboarding Progression

The game starts gently. Each quest line introduces one concept with breathing room. No auto-advance timers — the player moves at their own pace. See `decisions/2026-03-17T18:00:00_reduce_progression_intensity.md`. **Executive mandate.**

| Quest Line | Phase | What Unlocks | Key Moment |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0: Meet Your Gnome | 0 | Nothing — just garden + gnome + quest panel | Tap gnome → camera follows |
| 1: Start Your Garden | 1 | Seed tool (sow zones) + inspect panel | Plant seeds → discover species via inspect |
| 2: See Below the Surface | 2 | X-ray mode + lens picker (roots, irrigation) | See root networks + moisture heatmap |
| 3: Shape the Water | 3 | Shovel + full tool bar + events | Dig channels → first bloom → first bee |
| 4+: (WIP) | 4+ | Score panel, species tiers, full UI | Ecological discovery deepens |

**X-ray lens system:** X-ray is no longer on/off. It's a lens picker with multiple visualization modes. Each lens has a unique color theme. Current lenses: Roots (green, transparent ground), Irrigation (blue=wet, red=dry moisture heatmap). Future: Nutrients, Light, Soil composition.

**Inspect panel:** Tapping any cell shows species name, moisture level, light level in a warm overlay panel. Teaches observation before optimization.

## Gameplay Depth Principles

These principles define what makes the game *engaging over time*, not just legible at first glance. Every system, feature, and polish pass should be evaluated against them.

1. **The garden must feel alive, not just growing.** Fauna — pollinators, decomposers, birds, insects — are the connective tissue of the ecosystem. A flower isn't just pretty; it attracts a bee, which pollinates another flower, which spreads to a place you didn't plant it. Visible creatures moving through the garden tell the player the world has agency beyond their own actions.

2. **Surprise must reward observation.** The best moments are consequences the player didn't plan but can trace backward. You planted oak and wildflower near each other — now bees appeared, and the wildflower spreads faster via pollination you didn't arrange. Emergence isn't a side effect of simulation; it's the core delight. Design for interactions that produce outcomes neither species would achieve alone.

3. **Discovery must shift the player's mental model.** The game has a learning arc, not just a building arc:
   - First hour: "Seeds need soil and water — I need to dig channels from the spring." (Mechanics)
   - Third hour: "The oak's roots are stealing water from the birch." (Competition)
   - Tenth hour: "Clover fixes nitrogen, which feeds the oak, whose canopy shades the fern, which holds moisture for the moss." (Synergy)
   - Twentieth hour: "I can design a self-sustaining loop where every species serves a role." (Ecology as architecture)
   Without this progression, the game is a toy you exhaust in 20 minutes.

4. **Interactions, not just growth.** Species must affect each other — pollination, competition, symbiosis, decomposition, shelter. Not just "plant grows if water+light" but "plant thrives *because of its neighbors*." One visible interaction chain is worth ten independent growth scripts.

5. **The garden must exceed the player's plan.** Seed dispersal by wind, birds, or water should place plants where the player didn't. Dead wood should attract fungi. A puddle should attract insects. The garden should develop a life of its own that the player guides but doesn't fully control.

6. **The game must feel cozy, warm, and generous.** This is a place the player *wants to be*. Golden light, gentle particle effects, soft growth animations, ambient sounds of life. Mistakes don't punish — the garden recovers, pioneer species colonize bare patches, life finds a way. The emotional register is wonder, not stress.

7. **Idle time must be rewarding.** A player who stops clicking and just watches should see a living painting: pollinators drifting, light shifting, leaves swaying, worms working soil, slow growth unfolding. If the garden looks the same after 100 idle ticks, it's a screensaver. If it's visibly *different* — new fauna, shifted light, a seedling that appeared — it's alive.

8. **Recovery is a feature, not a failure state.** When the player floods, over-digs, or crowds, the response should be visible organic recovery — pioneer species, nutrient cycling, gradual recolonization. The garden's resilience teaches the player that experimentation is safe, making them bolder and more creative.

## Replayability Model

Replayability comes from two pillars working in concert:

1. **Knowledge Transfer** — Each garden teaches something that changes how you start the next one. The player's tenth garden is better not because of unlocks but because they *understand ecology*. Within a biome, this is the hour-to-hour "one more garden" hook.

2. **Biome Variety** — Each biome is both a content pack (new species, fauna, interactions, visual identity) and a difficulty curve (different ecological principles to master). Biomes are not ordered — any can be first, any can be last. Mastery doesn't transfer cleanly: systemic intuition carries over, but specific recipes don't. A temperate expert is a curious beginner in the desert. Visual identity is a pull motivator — the player wants to *see and feel* each biome's world.

The interplay: within a biome, knowledge transfer drives replay. Across biomes, variety drives replay. Cross-biome learning deepens overall ecological intuition. See `decisions/2026-03-15T18:00:00_replayability_model.md`.

## Autonomous Simulation Loop

The LLM player agent loop (Phases 1-3 in `groundwork-player`) exists to make these principles *reliable and measurable*. See `decisions/2026-03-15T12:00:00_llm_simulation_experiential_vision.md`, Target Moments and Big Yeses/Nos in `AGENTS.md`.

**Loop goal:** After a thousand autonomous runs *per biome*, surface the **3-5 specific interactions that make each biome magical** — then amplify them 1000x while cutting everything that doesn't serve them.

**What the loop must concretely test** (see AGENTS.md Big Yeses for full specs):
- Does the Nitrogen Handshake work? (clover near oak → visible faster growth, discoverable by planner)
- Does the Pollinator Bridge form? (flower cluster → fauna spawn → cross-pollination → population spread)
- Does the Root War read clearly? (competing trees → underground diagnosis → behavioral change)
- Does the Bird Express deliver gifts? (berry bush → bird → seed drop → unplanned beneficial plant)
- Does Pioneer Succession unfold? (bare soil → moss → grass → wildflower → shrub, autonomously)
- Does the Canopy Effect create niches? (tall tree shade → undergrowth layer of shade-loving species)

**When a winner surfaces:** Name it. Measure it. Make it gorgeous. Protect it with a regression test. Build adjacent interactions. Cut anything that competes for attention.

**Key evaluation shifts:**
- Evaluators must measure *delight* (unplanned-but-beneficial events, causal chain length, idle-period activity, discovery count) — not just material counts
- Skill extraction should capture *discoveries* ("clover near oak = faster growth") not just *techniques* ("place water at z=45")
- The LLM planner should be *curious*, not optimal — a planner that investigates surprises is more valuable than one that maximizes coverage
- Failure is redefined: a run where the garden dies but the planner discovers root competition is a *success* for the discovery arc
- The loop's nos are as important as its yeses: if a species never participates in chains, a fauna type never changes behavior, or a mechanic produces the same result every time — cut it

## Key Constraints

- **MVP scope is locked**: one temperate biome, 12-20 species, four systems (light/water/roots/ecology), one ~80×80×100 voxel garden bed (40m×40m×50m at 0.5m/voxel), continuous above/below-ground camera
- **Biome-ready architecture**: MVP ships temperate only, but sim architecture (species rosters, interaction rules, fauna triggers, visual palettes) must be data-driven and biome-parameterized — so adding a new biome is a content task, not a rewrite. Biomes are a core replayability pillar, not a P3 afterthought. See `decisions/2026-03-15T18:00:00_replayability_model.md`.
- **Fauna and interaction webs are MVP**, not post-MVP. A garden without visible life and species interactions cannot answer the canonical question. Even simple representations (particle-like bees, earthworm soil trails, bird silhouettes) count — fidelity can be low if the ecological *role* is clear.
- **Web is the primary player interface.** TUI/CLI continue as dev/debug tools.
- **Do not** expand beyond MVP, add economies/multiplayer/narrative (auto-P3), optimize realism over readability, or hide cause-and-effect
- **Decision rule when uncertain**: (1) make ecological cause-and-effect more readable, (2) reward player observation with surprise, (3) keep the build smaller, (4) increase player delight sooner
- **Source of truth order**: game vision > Manager backlog > player feedback > build notes > older discussion

## Priority Definitions

- **P0** = blocks core proof or makes build unusable
- **P1** = strongly improves clarity, feel, or core loop
- **P2** = valuable but not required for MVP
- **P3** = future/expansion (auto-assigned to new biomes, economies, multiplayer, narrative)
